          The London Restaurant is London's Great II designated fine dining restaurant for tourists on the River Thames.
          We offer a seasonal tasting menu from our British head chef, featuring modern and elegant dishes rooted in
          technique but stripped of essentials.
          Our focus is on sourcing the best ingredients that the British Isles have to offer, with dishes inspired by
          our head chef's overseas training and other food cultures.

            of the ingredients to the maximum, and the dishes are prepared simply and dynamically.
